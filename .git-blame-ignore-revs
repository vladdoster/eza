# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
# You can set this file as a default ignore file for blame by running
# the following command.
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# To temporarily not use this file add
# --ignore-revs-file=""
# to your blame command.
#
# The ignoreRevsFile can't be set globally due to blame failing if the file isn't present.
# To not have to set the option in every repository it is needed in,
# save the following script in your path with the name "git-bblame"
# now you can run
# $ git bblame $FILE
# to use the .git-blame-ignore-revs file if it is present.
#
# #!/usr/bin/env bash
# repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
# if [[ -e $repo_root/.git-blame-ignore-revs ]]; then
#     git blame --ignore-revs-file="$repo_root/.git-blame-ignore-revs" $@
# else
#     git blame $@
# fi
